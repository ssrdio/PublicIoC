# About 
The attack primarily targets development companies with the aim of gaining initial access to their corporate infrastructure. The attack typically begins with a LinkedIn message posing as a legitimate development opportunity or business proposal. The message is designed to entice the recipient by offering a project or job, often tailored to the company's expertise. Once the recipient engages, attackers may attempt to gather information, deploy phishing links, or gain unauthorized access to critical systems, using this initial contact as a foothold into the company's network.
