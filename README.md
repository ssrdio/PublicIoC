## IoC
1. **Cest La Vie** It appears that this attack is linked to North Korean threat actors. In this instance, instead of targeting job hunters, as they have done in the past, they shifted their focus to a development company. This change in target highlights their evolving tactics, possibly aiming to exploit vulnerabilities within corporate infrastructures and gain access to sensitive development environments. All the files related to this incident, including the malicious payloads and supporting documentation, are [available](CestLaVie/README.md) for further analysis and investigation.
